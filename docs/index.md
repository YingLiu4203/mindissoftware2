# Welcome

This is my thoughts in software development. It has development blogs and technical articles.

To categorize the blogs and articles, I plan to use three dimensional tags:

- Development phases: study, plan, design, code, test, operation.
- Technology fields: programming languages (C#, JS, TS, Rust), db(SQLite, Firebase, PostgreSQL), network (message queue, channel, RPC, Socket), compiler, platforms (.net, asp.net), crypto, algorithm ...
- Projects: for project-related blogs, add the project name as one tag.
